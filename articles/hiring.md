# Hiring quality

The goal of the hiring process is to satisfy the needs of the company in acquiring and retaining new employees. The hired employees should be capable (or almost capable) of doing the work the team cannot do.

The overall hiring quality can be defined as the efficiency of the hiring process, i.e. how efficiently company is able to acquire, ramp up and retain new employees which satisfy the needs.

Efficiency can be defined as:
- Retention: the length of time new hires stay at the company
- Time to fill: the time it takes to hire a required specialist
- Hiring satisfaction: the satisfaction of the hiring managers 
- Ramp-up time: An employee’s time to full productivity
- Job performance: measured by supervisors’ performance ratings or objective data like sales
- Employee engagement: Measured by the new hire’s self-ratings
- Cultural fit: Measured by 360 ratings of the new hire’s colleagues and supervisors


This article is devoted to the quality of the hiring process as I see it implemented in many companies.

1. Hiring process has the goal of finding a candidate who is capable of doing the job.

2. Hiring process usually consists of the sourcing and interviewing stages.

Both steps require a decision:

- Sourcing — if the candidate is suitable for the interview stage
- Interview — if the candidate is suitable for the job

3. From the decision making theory, a good decision is made based on _good_ (i.e, _valuable_) information. From the information theory prospective, information is only valuable when it meets the following requirements:

- it is understood by the recipient
- it is actual and relevant to the aspect in question
- it is accurate — as errors lead to bad decisions, information needs to be passed to the right person or costs will increase
- it is complete — contains all relevant data with no gaps
- it is trustworthy — information recipient needs to trust the information on its relevancy, accuracy and completeness

Let's review the sourcing stage from this perspective.

## Sourcing

Sourcing stage usually implies looking for candidates "from the job market". Companies compose and submit a _job description_ to their "careers" page, job boards or through a hiring agency. Then recruiters either actively look for candidates, or passively await for candidates to apply. If the recruiters search for candidates, the search is usually being done based on the public candidate profile (such as LinkedIn) or their CVs on the job sites.

Job description is a description of the essence of the job. This is not a detailed a list of duties, but instead includes the primary functions of the position.

This is the first phase where information is seriously lost, as we see usually the job description containing mainly two things: requirements to know certain instruments, tools and languages; and vaguely described responsibilities.

Job activities are much more than that, and it is not possible to reduce participating in teamwork to a text description.

To reduce information loss in describing what the job is, techniques such as "[job analysis](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/pages/performingjobanalysis.aspx)" are used to define the job in question.

[Job and Work Analysis: Methods, Research, and Applications for Human Resource Management](https://www.amazon.com/Job-Work-Analysis-Applications-Management-ebook/dp/B07PMTQL2Q/) book states that the best instrument for job analysis is _observing_, where the analyst either works alongside (pair?) or just sits closely with the person and observes.






4. Sourcing the candidate and making a decision if they are suitable for the interview is first done based on the candidate CV.

Candidates prepare their CV to present information to the hiring personnel. Hiring managers and recruiters process the CV to decide if the candidate should proceed to the interviews stage.

There's a significant amount of noise and bias in this step.

Usually candidates put the following data in their CVs:

- places of work with years spent in each company on each position
- work achievements
- education, certificates, trainings
- personal information: hobbies, pet projects



Human beings are always irrational, 


Job positions in different companies are different! 
People rarely produce results individually, usually teams produce value. Ability to produce value is team's emergent quality

Teams have [emergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) properties, only teams can produce value for the client. [more links here?]

People working on a team collaborate to be able to collectively deliver the value for the clients.

There is no way to determine the individual impact on the collective result. This, by the way, is the reason why [individual performance review practice](https://qase.io/blog/performance-reviews-and-quality/) makes no sense.

As it is impossible to calculate the individual impact, stating in a CV that a certain percentage of a certain product was done by a person can be considered a lie.

## Hiring quality

Hire/no-hire is a decision that needs to be made.

According to [Decision Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-theory/), any decision needs to be done based on "good information".

Theory of information says:
> Information is only useful if it benefits the recipient
> if better decisions result from the use of information, then the information is of value
>
> data capture (collecting and recording it) involves a cost and does not produce value
> when the data is communicated and understood it becomes information
> (Data here is crude facts collected)

Information is considered valuable when it meets the following requirements:

- understood by the recipient
- relevant — related to aspect of work, in good time
- accurate — errors lead to bad decisions, information needs to be passed to the right person or costs will increase
- complete — contains all relevant data with no gaps
- confident — recipient need to trust the information on its relevancy, accuracy, completeness.

In order to reason about the hiring process quality, thorough review from the decision making theory prospective is required.

Usual hiring process comprises several steps:
1. sourcing the candidate
2. interviewing the candidate
3. negotiating and signing the contract

Each step requires a decision — either to proceed with the candidate or skip.

## 1. Sourcing the candidate

In most companies recruiting team receives a request for a candidate.

Request is composed in most cases of two methods:
- specifying the job description on some website and waiting for the candidates to apply
- specifying the job description and searching for candidates

There's inherent information loss on the first step of both methods: in preparing the job description, and in filtering candidates based on the perception of matching their CVs to the job description.

Candidates prepare their [CV](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/curriculum+vitae)s to present some valuable information to the hiring personnel. Hiring managers and recruiters process the CV to decide if the candidate should proceed to the next stage: interviews.

The decision in question here is "candidate to proceed to the next stage".


The use of [CV](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/curriculum+vitae)s in the industry seems like a bad ritual: companies demand candidates to send CVs, candidates struggle to compose them, recruiters and hiring managers struggle to interpret them.

There is a list of problems with the use of CVs in hiring, but the main two are:
- signal/noise ratio on all the stages of CV preparation and processing
- value of information

Value of information


From the decision theory standpoint, our target scenario for the hiring decision is 'the person quickly onboards and starts successfully collaborating with others'.


Some information (signal) can be transferred via CV with pretty much no noise added, such as diplomas and certification.

Work history is getting worse.

Let's consider a common line "Software developer, Microsoft, 2012-2015".

What information (signal) does "Microsoft, 2012-2015" line convey? Evidently, that the person worked at this company during the specified time in a certain role.

What is the value of this information? Does this information provide _any_ prediction if the person will successfully work at your company _now_? If not, do we need this information at all? Maybe it will even trigger [Halo effect bias](https://simplypsychology.org/halo-effect.html)?

CV Tailoring is an advice to add noise: https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/mar/15/cv-tips-first-arts-job

я вижу так:

есть понимание человека своих достижений d, это функция p (d)

функция эта очень “шумная”, потому что на сигнал d накладывается дохуя шумов самооценкой, тем, как эти достижения d оценивал работодатель прошлый (травил или хвалил) и проч

есть мнение человека, как это понимание p(d) транслировать наружу, в резюме, m(p(d)

это мнение ещё “шумнее”, потому что вон статьи про оформление там почитал, ещё Вася сказал, как делать надо, а Петя сказал, как делать не надо

потом есть мнение разбирающего по поводу того, что написано r(m(p(d)

оно тоже очень шумное, потому что разбирающий поначитался тоже статей и имеет свой опыт и свои bias’ы

и вот так каждый раз на сигнал d мы накидываем и накидываем дикое количество шумов

и что самое забавное — эти самые достижения человека d изначальные по сути определяются не человеком практически, а дизайном команды / системы

то есть ценность вообще всех этих приседаний по попытке в этих тьмах шумов разобрать-таки этот самый сигнал d — почти никакая, околонулевая



логично, что с точки зрения decision theory последовательность принятия решений в процессе подбора и отбора для компании и для сотрудника “конгруентна”, но вот количество потерь информации разное и причины потерь информации совсем разные

но результат один — хуёво принимаемые решения слева приводят к повышенной нагрузке справа


и что самое любопытное: компаниям улучшить качество предоставляемой для кандидатов информации сильно проще

просто делаем нормальный job analysis и всё по сути

а вот кандидату, кажется, улучшить качество предоставляемой для компании информации почти невозможно никак

что приводит к логичному, но сперва кажущемуся нелогичным выводу: раз компания заинтересована в кандидате больше, чем кандидат в компании, то именно компании и выгодно улучшать информацию предоставляемую кандидату

и это должен быть самый первый шаг в оптимизации процессов подбора и отбора

таким образом она улучшит процесс принятия решения у кандидата, и сильно улучшит тем самым весь процесс подбора и отбора (потому что shift left)

@mickiedesman

и только вторым шагом уже будет улучшение подбора, то есть категорическое уменьшение количества кандидатов в очереди
