## Part 2 — Work design and communication

[Part 1](remote.md) explores ergonomics-related negative factors of home office setting.

This article delves into remote work issues related to psychology of work.

[Research on the psychology of work](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ellen-Kossek/publication/258139922_Supervisory_Approaches_and_Paradoxes_in_Managing_Telecommuting_Implementation/links/562572e108aeedae57daeab8/Supervisory-Approaches-and-Paradoxes-in-Managing-Telecommuting-Implementation.pdf) conclude that negative factors inherent to home office work need to be addressed to ensure good performance, and that remote work is only useful if it is effectively implemented and supported by supervisors throughout the organization.

### Psychological contracts, relational communication, and coworker relationship

The first thing regulating employee’s work is the formal signed contract.

Formal contracts may not be able to clearly outline all potential actions and expected behaviors, and even the terms of such contracts can be open to interpretation due to the inherent ambiguity of language. As [Dennis Darland says](http://dennisdarland.com/philosophy/Symbolic_Ambiguity.html):

> Whenever there is a symbol-r relation of a public word to a object, there will be psychological events for each person using that public word. It is pretty much impossible to compare these psychological events, so, even though it is the psychological event is each person that means the object for that person, it is generally impossible to directly talk about these psychological events.

Multiple [studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226857215_Psychological_and_Implied_Contracts_in_Organisations) have delved deeper into the topic of subjectivity in agreements and have concluded that subjectivity is an inherent part of any agreement formed through a relationship or interaction over time between parties. Even with written contracts outlining wages and other forms of compensation, employees who have been with the company for a long period of time may believe that their job encompasses more than just the financial aspect.

The subjective interpretation of the formal contracts, combined with unspoken expectations, cultural and psychological factors present in the work environment, can influence an employee's behavior through what is known as a [psychological contract](https://oxford-review.com/oxford-review-encyclopaedia-terms/psychological-contract/).

Another [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230253705_The_psychological_contract_and_the_transition_from_office-based_to_home-based_work) defines psychological contracts as ‘obligations employees _believe_ they owe their employer and what they can expect in return for fulfilling these obligations’.

In office settings, psychological contracts are often maintained naturally through informal communication and the opportunity to observe others. The assimilation of the company culture in the office is done through social [social conformity](https://www.simplypsychology.org/conformity.html) mechanisms. In contrast, working from home often involves only work-related communication and can lead to a lack of casual interactions.

[Studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563222000620) have emphasized the significance of relational communication within organizations in regards to well-being and coping.

[Other research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230253705_The_psychological_contract_and_the_transition_from_office-based_to_home-based_work) has revealed that remote work leads to a decrease in relational communication which negatively impacts the influence of leaders, diminishes the quality of communication and has an impact on the employee's well-being. Moreover, companies managing remote employees frequently express concerns about the loss of organizational cohesion and control over those employees.

[Recent studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23970022221083695) suggest that the decrease in relational communication in a home office environment not only diminishes psychological contracts but also increases feelings of loneliness and social isolation. Furthermore, [other research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19025257/) has determined that social isolation and loneliness negatively impacts employee's job performance.

[Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00909882.2011.556136) have found that it is crucial for coworkers to have positive relationships in a remote work setting. Coworker liking experience provides a buffer effect for conflicts and disagreements.

If a manager tries to improve relational communication among employees in a remote work setting by mandating more online communication without considering the potential risks, things can actually get worse as the internet has a [tendency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8559783/) to increase polarization. People are more accepting of differences when communicating in person.

Without the opportunity for offline bonding experiences, coworkers may become more isolated from one another. This can lead to a negative spiral where the worse colleagues get along, the worse the situation becomes.

In a remote work setting, it is important to put in extra effort to overcome feelings of alienation and to build and maintain good relationships with coworkers.

[Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5831839/) from various domains and cultures indicate that team-building activities outside of work, such as [team lunches](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34031035/) and [book clubs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21708871/), can enhance inter-team communication, morale, and overall atmosphere in an office setting.

I hypothesize that the benefits of these out-of-work bonding activities are even greater in a remote online work environment.

Gallup [says](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/397058/increasing-importance-best-friend-work.aspx):

> our data shows that having a "best friend" at work has become more important since the start of the pandemic, even considering the dramatic increase in remote and hybrid work.

At Qase, we work entirely remotely with our teams located in Georgia, USA, and Turkey. To counteract the challenges posed by the lack of face-to-face communication, we engage in the following activities:

1. A regular acting club where employees volunteer for acting training and collaborate on their presentations. These presentations are then shared during our [meetups](https://qase.io/blog/qa-meetup-2/) and online team talks. [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33173473/) has shown the benefits of acting training in increasing empathy and enhancing emotional regulation. Furthermore, organising an offline activity like a meetup and giving presentations there provides an additional social reward for employees, which strengthens their bond with the team.

2. Occasional online gaming sessions where employees choose a game and play together online. This approach has been proven effective according to [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904954/).

3. A weekly "random coffee" tradition where randomly paired employees are given a 15-minute slot to video-call each other and chat about anything unrelated to work. This simulates the casual conversations that would occur in an office setting.

4. Every other week, a demo video call followed by a "happy hour" where employees engage in non-work-related conversation. This hour is an opportunity for informal communication.

Companies with larger budgets often organize regular in-person meetings by bringing all employees to one location. For example, [1Password](https://1password.com) holds an annual week-long meeting where all employees work and play together. Other companies such as [Automattic](https://automattic.com), [Dell](https://www.dell.com/en-us), [Glitch](https://glitch.com), [GitHub](https://github.com), [Timely](https://timelyapp.com) and others sponsor employee travel and arrange for everyone to stay in the same place for at least one day each year.

### Connectedness and overtime

Overtime work has been [shown to negatively impact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617405/) an employee's motivation, performance, well-being, and health.

To address this, many countries have regulations on the maximum amount of work time allowed. Experienced managers often discourage overtime work. Office setting makes overtime visible and easy to discourage.

Geographic distribution of remote teams can lead to the expectation of working longer hours in order to participate in synchronous meetings and activities.

For example, daily morning meetings may require employees to start their workday earlier or work longer hours.

Additionally, [studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0018726709349199) show that a remote work arrangement engenders a sense of obligation from workers where they reciprocate with greater extensive and intensive effort.

Remote workers often report that they felt the need to be available to the business, perhaps reflecting a recognition of the importance for those with less face time to be proactively available.

It is evident that employees working remotely desire to put in extra effort. Combined with overtime work, this leads to stress and burnout.

Chronic stress and burnout [can damage the brain](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/01/160121121818.htm) and lead to increased turnover or [quality loss](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2022.4311).

To prevent overwork, management must take serious action. This includes establishing a culture of continuous feedback so that employees feel fairly recognized for their efforts and do not feel like they are not working enough.

Furthermore, managers should never encourage employees to report the amount of time spent on tasks.

Three out of [fourteen Deming’s key principles of management](https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points/) are of essential importance:

> 8. Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company.
> 
> 11b. Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers, numerical goals. Substitute leadership.
> 
> 12a. Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality.

At Qase, we follow a "work window" schedule where each team agrees on a three-hour time frame when everyone is available for collaboration, including pair or mob programming. During this window, employees work together effectively. Outside of this window, employees are free to work at their own convenience.

### Trust and autonomy

Working remotely generally means that employees are given more independence in their work and are not necessarily under direct supervision. As a result, management [may not have the same level of visibility](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Trust-and-the-virtual-organization-Handy/ddec1c0980608896749c2cea4ea9225f8849d17b) into the actual work being done by these employees, and this might become an issue.

Numerous [studies have indicated](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235277778_Teleworking_-_the_perception-reality_gap) that for many managers, the inability to see and directly observe their employees working can lead to a lack of trust in those employees.

Some [scientists have even suggested](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246755382_Managing_A_Virtual_Workplace) that this lack of trust may be a contributing factor in the challenges that many organizations face when attempting to implement remote work arrangements. They say that lack of trust can undermine any precaution take to ensure successful virtual work arrangements.

According to [various studies](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/14635770510600357/full/html?skipTracking=true), the level of maturity and preparedness of management is a key factor in determining the success or failure of remote work arrangements. If managers are not ready or willing to trust their employees to work independently and without close supervision, it is likely that any attempts to implement remote work will be ineffective.

[Research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2443551) that the absence of physical contact can have a detrimental effect on trust and collaboration.

All this highlights the necessity for proper management training, which can be initiated by studying books such as "[Out of the crisis](https://www.amazon.com/Out-Crisis-Press-Edwards-Deming/dp/0262541157)" by Deming and "[Classic writings on management](https://www.amazon.com/Ackoffs-Best-Classic-Writings-Management/dp/0471316342)" by Akoff. At Qase, we have an internal management training program that focuses on Systems Theory and the Theory of Constraints.

### Knowledge sharing

Effective software development requires ongoing learning and the efficient sharing of knowledge.

[Studies on the knowledge sharing process](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09585192.2010.516600) have found that the learning process is highly social and relational in nature. Scientists say that knowledge does not constitute an autonomous or separate entity, but it is by nature embedded in individuals who produce, interpret, duplicate, modify or learn it.

Remote work, which can lead to feelings of isolation and "desocialization", can hinder the sharing of knowledge.

[Research on knowledge sharing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28379919/) state that specialized professional knowledge and working alone to be the biggest barriers to knowledge sharing.

If managers do not recognize the threat of remote work for the cognitive and relational factors facilitating knowledge transfer, the potential gains from remote work could be undermined by insidious longer-term negative impacts on the firm’s knowledge base.

As knowledge sharing [can’t be effectively enforced](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/200909/seven-sins-our-system-forced-education), people need to be empowered to teach and learn. Learning culture has to be instantiated.

Companies employ different practices for empowering knowledge sharing: pair programming, professional clubs or chapters, internal talks and meetups, assigning mentors and buddies to newjoiners.

At Qase, we employ pair and mob programming, as [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1071581914001207) has shown that this approach is one of the most effective ways to share knowledge and requires very little instructional training for employees.

### Conclusions

There is no perfect method for working, but remote work provides companies with a global pool of talent and lower costs for hiring and operations. However, it also has negative impacts on team productivity, morale, and retention that often go unnoticed.

In order to make remote work efficient, it is necessary to first understand all the negative factors that may be impacting it. This understanding will allow for the implementation of effective solutions to address those issues.
