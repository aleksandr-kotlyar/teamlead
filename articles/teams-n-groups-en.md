I have a thesis: what we call "teams" in our managerial work is actually "working groups".

Let's start with definitions. What is a "working group"? It's a collective of workers united by space (whether it's an office or a virtual one) and professional activity. They interact with each other and act as a whole. If a group of people just stands at a bus stop waiting for a bus, they are not a working group. A working group requires coordination, for example, when a manager distributes tasks among the group members.

However, a team is much more interesting. There are many definitions of what a "team" is. A team is a collective with a high level of cohesion and commitment to common goals. In a team, informal relationships between members play a major role. A team is a group of people with common goals, complementary skills, a high level of interdependence, and shared responsibility for achievements. Unlike a working group, interaction within a team does not require managerial coordination.

A bit about history. In 1924, there was a scientist named Elton Mayo. He conducted a series of experiments. In one of the experiments, an electrical equipment manufacturing company invited him to understand how to increase team productivity. Mayo agreed to experiment with a group of employees.

The first experiment was about increasing lighting. After that, the group's productivity increased. However, when the lighting was reduced again, productivity remained high. The discussion showed that employees saw management's care and started working better. This is what HR calls "engagement". When managers care about the team, it boosts their productivity.

Mayo also noted that effective work is the work done by a team. He formulated that relationships and belonging in a team are very important for productivity. After him, many researchers studied motivation theories. For example, the well-known Maslow's theory states that after meeting basic needs, people have a need for belonging and recognition.

The second scientist I'd like to discuss is Herzberg. His works have been criticized, and based on surveys, he conducted questionable studies. However, following Maslow's humanistic theme, Herzberg argued that employee satisfaction comes from the work process itself, not the conditions. If demotivating factors, such as poor leadership or low pay, are eliminated, employees will find pleasure in their work and improve relationships within the team.

Furthermore, the remarkable researcher Solomon Asch conducted a study on "Social Conformity". He explored how an individual's behavior can be mediated by team design or circumstances. From an evolutionary biology perspective, humans survived and thrived as a social species. This supports the theory that our actions heavily depend on the team's design and the behavior of team members.

There's also an intriguing story about "Mowgli" - people who survived in the forest during their childhood. If such children spend more than six years in the forest, they struggle to adapt upon returning to society. One theory suggests that we learn through the imprinting mechanism in early childhood, and language is one aspect we learn in this manner.

We are heavily influenced by society. There's an intriguing study related to relationships and quality. This study found that an increase in the percentage of people leaving a conveyor production company, even with strict quality control, led to a decrease in product quality and an increase in product failures. This can be explained from a psychological perspective. Let's say Jane and Alice work side by side on a conveyor. They both assemble parts. They communicate and have a relationship. If Alice leaves and is replaced by someone Jane doesn't know, the quality of his work begins to decline, even if the company has strict quality control.

There's a concept called "mental Set". I define it as a limitation of our rationality due to habituation. I once wrote an article about this. The essence is that when you get used to using a hammer, you start seeing nails everywhere. Often, individuals find it hard to break out of this biased mode of thinking, where they perceive all new problems through the lens of old ones, even if the problems are entirely new. This is because our brain tries to save energy by presenting us with existing solutions. Many interesting experiments have been conducted on this topic. The most well-known among them are the candle and matchstick experiments. A group rarely copes with the "mental set", only a team can handle it if there's enough diversity and good relationships within. A simple way for individual team members to deal with this is to organize a brainstorming session. This brainstorming works well not in a group, but in a team because there's trust within a team.

Social anthropology actively explores the themes of teams and groups. Anthropologists argue that a company is an open system influenced by society. For instance, if the majority of society is poor, a company will face one set of challenges, and if the majority is wealthy, it will encounter different challenges. However, sometimes a company might exert even stronger influence on its employees' behavior, considering that most people spend more time at work than outside of it. As a result, people accustomed to a certain behavior at work might behave similarly in their daily lives. This can lead to professional deformation in various specializations. Belbin identified what he called "team roles". He asserted that to ensure a team's productivity, there should be a full representation of these roles. It's not just about a manager allocating tasks or integrating them, but about having every role represented within the team. Thus, synergy within a team emerges only when there is a full representation of team roles.

I argue that people are inherently good until we "corrupt" them. The design of a team or system can make people behave individualistically. However, even then, they strive to help each other. For instance, an overburdened programmer still wishes to contribute to the team, helping a newcomer, despite being busy. The environment in which people are can be designed to stimulate better behavior. In the US, an experiment was conducted in shelters with cats that were planned to be euthanized. These cats were given to inmates, and it was noticed that the behavior of the inmates improved. They started working more to buy something tasty for their cat. Another interesting example from the US is the concept of "crime prevention through environmental design", where the design of urban environments is studied for its impact on crime rates. One of the findings is that in affluent areas where homes don't have fences, the theft rate is lower. This is because potential thieves are afraid of being noticed. Thus, the right environmental design can promote better human behavior.

To summarize, we can highlight the following key points:

- Teamwork is more productive: Numerous studies confirm that teamwork is more efficient than individual or group work.
- Teamwork is more creative: In a team, it's possible to overcome "mental sets", conduct "brainstorming", and achieve better results due to a trusting atmosphere.
- Quality of teamwork: Research statistics indicate that the results of teamwork, for example in programming, are of higher quality compared to individual or group work. This is particularly evident in the number of defects.
- Relationships are the key to successful teamwork: It's not so much the roles of "senior" or "junior", but the quality of relationships within the team and the design of the working environment that determine the team's success. The main components of relationships are:
	- Trust: The foundation of any team relationship.
	- Affiliation: The sense of belonging and involvement of every team member.
	- System and environment design: From the choice of whom to hire to how to train and work, the design of the system and working environment plays a crucial role in shaping relationships within the team.

Trust is a complex and multifaceted concept that plays a key role in relationships between people.

Trust arises when a person, for example, Masha, has the opportunity to harm another but chooses not to. This can manifest in various forms â€“ showing one's vulnerability, demonstrating ignorance or insecurity, and in other moments. The key is the lack of control one person has over another.
When a manager demonstrates something to an employee, it doesn't always build trust. Meanwhile, trust between employees can be much stronger because neither has control over the other.
Game Theory studies trust and the advantages of systems based on trust. It emphasizes that in situations where participants don't divide limited resources but strive to create more, trust becomes beneficial. Research confirms that trust can lead to higher productivity and better results in teams.

Relationships within a team are crucial for its success and productivity. One of the primary types of these relationships is commitment.

Essence of Commitment: It's the willingness of every team member to strive for a common goal and pride in what the team achieves. An example of such commitment is when an employee says, "My product team creates a great product, and I'm proud to be a part of it."

By nature, humans have a tendency to form groups. We easily divide ourselves into groups based on various attributes, whether it's skin color, religion, or simply belonging to a particular team. Within such a group, people feel more protected and closer to each other.

A manager who is part of the team might better understand the needs and ambitions of the team. However, if the manager stands apart from the team, he might not have the same level of commitment.

A key element of teamwork is having a shared mission or goal. For instance, the company Lego aims to make children happy. A shared mission helps the team stay focused and aimed at achieving results.

Let's discuss one of the key dysfunctions that can negatively impact a team - performance reviews.

Performance reviews are typically individualistic and often tied to bonuses. This can induce competitiveness among team members, which in turn can dismantle the team spirit.
Introducing a performance review system in a team can lead to questions about fairness. For example, why does one employee get a bonus and another doesn't? This can lead to discord, envy, and a loss of trust.
In reality, it's almost impossible to evaluate an individual's contribution to a team project. Hence, any attempt at evaluation can be perceived as unfair.
Consequences for the Team: Due to the implementation of performance review systems, a team might devolve into a group of separate individuals. This can result in a drop in work quality, deterioration of relationships, and increased employee turnover.

Let's explore another significant dysfunction in team dynamics â€” task distribution and situational management.

In intellectual work, where each task has a high degree of variation, traditional task distribution is inefficient.
The times of Taylor, where he timed how long a worker took to perform a routine task, are long gone. This approach was efficient for optimizing low-variation processes.
In modern work, especially intellectual, each task is unique. Distributing tasks based on statistics in this context is ineffective, regardless of the methodology, e.g., Kanban.
Distributing tasks can lead to conflicts and a loss of trust within a team. Employees may question the selection of tasks, their complexity, and priority.
Distributing tasks reduces the sense of belonging in a team. When everyone works on their tasks, the feeling of unity and a shared direction, like "making children happy" as in Lego's mission, dissipates.
The process of task distribution, especially in high-variation contexts, can turn a team into a group of separate individuals.

Let's delve into an important topic: motivation.

If you encounter an HR specialist or team leader aiming to motivate someone, recommend that they familiarize themselves with literature on production process organization and psychology.
Deming asserted that 95% of productivity is determined by the process design, and only 5% by individual effort. Thus, managers should focus on optimizing processes, not on individual motivation.
Also Yerkes-Dodson Law emphasizes that the level of motivation varies depending on the task type. Crucially, only intrinsic motivation is effective in intellectual work; external stimuli often suppress interest.
Regular 1-1 meetings aimed at understanding an employee's motivation can erode trust and diminish a sense of belonging. If a manager consistently questions an employee's motivation, it can breed feelings of control and mistrust.

Motivation is a complex and multifaceted process. Before attempting to motivate a team, a manager should focus on optimizing work processes and fostering a positive team atmosphere.

Let's discuss another dysfunction commonly practiced in corporate settings: Individual Development Plans (IDPs).

The term "individual" in the context of development should raise concerns for managers. Our goal is to develop a team, not isolated individuals within it.
If we focus on individual development, we are essentially resorting to Taylorism, trying to make people interchangeable cogs within a large machine. It doesn't work.
It's more effective when development happens at the team level. For example, during mob programming, where each member can share their expertise and knowledge.
Issues with IDPs: The main problem is that individuals often can't precisely identify what interests them until they try something new. If management dictates the direction of development, it can kill intrinsic motivation.
Peter Principle states that in hierarchical systems, everyone eventually rises to their level of incompetence. The question is: do we really want that?
Fixating on a specific role or specialization can lead to professional deformation and a loss of diversity in problem-solving approaches.

Management theory and many research studies conducted in companies demonstrate that a team always outperforms groups in terms of productivity and adaptability. Why?

- Adaptability: A team can adapt faster and more efficiently to market changes compared to separate groups or individuals.
- Antifragility: A team has the ability to withstand challenges, while a group might quickly disintegrate when faced with problems.
- Relationships: The essence of teamwork lies in strong, informal relationships between its members, allowing the team to operate more cohesively and efficiently.

I highlighted four main dysfunctions that can destroy a team and turn it into a mere group of people. It's crucial to recognize and avoid these dysfunctions to maintain team dynamics.
